# 👋 Hey, I’m Razo Beckett

Welcome to my little corner of the web!  
I'm a curious technologist, passionate about Linux, open-source, automation, DevOps, and building tools that just *work*. Whether it's scripting my way through a problem or crafting something useful with Go or Python, I love creating things that make life a little easier—and a lot more interesting.

## 💻 What I Do
I spend most of my time tinkering with:
- 🐧 Linux systems (NixOS & Arch are close to heart)
- 🛠️ Automation using Bash, Ansible, and Home-Lab setups
- 🧠 Learning by building – from password managers to deployment pipelines
- 🎨 Beautifying terminal apps and GitHub READMEs (because aesthetics matter too)
- 💬 Sharing my learnings, rants, and discoveries right here on this blog

## 👤 Who I Am
I'm Mayur Raut — also known online as Razo Beckett.  
This blog is where I get real. Expect honest takes, behind-the-scenes breakdowns of projects I build, and maybe even the occasional rant about tech that’s trying too hard.
